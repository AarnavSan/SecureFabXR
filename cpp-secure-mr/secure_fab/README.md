# Secure Fab XR - Identification and Instruction in SecureMR

## Real-time Object detection based on identified part
This project demonstrates real-time object tracking for a particular selected object based on instructions in mixed reality.

## Model Used

| Application    | Model | Source |
|----------------|-------|--------|
| Part Detection | YOLOv11 Detection (YOLOX variant) | [Qualcomm AI Hub - YOLOv11 Detection](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/models/yolov11_det?searchTerm=yolo) |

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the functionalities and usage of the SecureMR interfaces through a part detection application. The application achieves customized MR-based effects with deployment of an optimized YOLO-based machine learning model.

The project provides utility classes located under [`./base/securemr_utils`](base/securemr_utils/README.md) to simplify development of SecureMR-enabled applications.

A Docker configuration is contained under the `Docker/` directory for deploying custom algorithm packages.

## Prerequisite

#### (A) To run the application, you will need

1. A PICO 4 Ultra device with the latest system update (OS version >= 5.14.0U)
2. Android Studio, with the Android SDK and NDK installed.
   - You can install the Android SDK via the SDK Manager in Android Studio (`Tools` > `SDK Manager`).
   - You will need Android SDK Platform 34. You can install it from the `SDK Platforms` tab in the SDK Manager.
   - The suggested NDK version is 25. You can install a specific NDK version from the `SDK Tools` tab. Check "Show Package Details", find `NDK (Side by side)` and select a `25.x.x` version to install.
3. Gradle and Android Gradle plugin (usually bundled with Android Studio install),
   suggested Gradle version = 8.7, Android Gradle Plugin version = 8.3.2
4. Java version at least 17 (required by the Android Gradle Plugin), recommended to be 21

#### (B) To run Docker for model conversion, you will need

1. Docker Desktop installed

## Deployment and Test

1. Install and configure according to the [prerequisite](#prerequisite).
1. Open the repository root in Android Studio as an Android project
1. After project sync, you will find the `secure_fab` module under the `samples` folder
1. Connect to a PICO 4 Ultra device with the latest OS update installed
1. Select the `secure_fab` module and click the launch button

Alternatively, build and install via command line:
```bash
./gradlew :samples:secure_fab:assembleDebug
adb install -r samples/secure_fab/build/outputs/apk/debug/secure_fab-debug.apk
```
